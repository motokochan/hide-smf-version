Rant
----
Not normal for my README, but this one deserves it.

This mod is in response to the many people asking for a way to hide the version
of SMF they are running. Many are mistaken in that it will help them avoid
attacks. This is incorrect. Most "hackers" nowadays are nothing more than
bored script kiddies that run packs to try anything and everything and see what
sticks. It doesn't matter if you aren't running on Windows, or you don't have
Joomla!, Drupal, or phpBB installed as the scripts will try attacks for those
things anyway.

Regardless, people constantly complain about the need to hide the version from
public view. This mod was created so they can do this safely while still being
able to see important updates in the admin area.
